# Google Clone

This was made in order to practice some HTML and CSS.

There are two branches, the **master** and the **2ndVersion**

- 2ndVersion is the first attempt, it is not as accurate with some styles.

- master is almost indentical as the google page and it has upgrades with some HTML tags.
