# Google Clon

This was made in order to practice some HTML and CSS.

There are two branches, the **master** and the **altVersion**

master is the first version, it is not as accurate with some styles.

altVersion is almost indentical as the google page and it has upgrades with some HTML tags.

[Here]() you can see the first version
